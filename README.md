# Image Caption Generator

## Project Overview
A web app that generates natural language captions for images using Salesforce's BLIP model and Gradio UI.It lets users upload any image and instantly receive an accurate, natural-language description.
The project is built with Python, Hugging Face Transformers, and Gradio to provide a smooth interactive interface.

## Problem Statement
Students face difficulty organizing research notes across multiple formats. This app uses AI-powered document captioning to help manage and summarize large sets of academic images and documents using BLIP.This project solves that problem by using an advanced AI model to automatically generate meaningful image captions in real time.

---

## Solution Summary
Upload an image and instantly receive a descriptive caption generated by a state-of-the-art AI model. The app uses BLIP for retrieval and Hugging Face's API for model access.It provides an intuitive Gradio web UI where users can upload images or test with examples.
